 👋 Hi, I’m @pandas8888

I like working on mods for Stardew Valley (although I currently have none under my belt -- that's what this is for).
My goals are to make a few Content Patcher mods while I improve my C# coding skills, then try to make something a bit more in depth 😁

I'll be on Nexus. https://www.nexusmods.com/users/75911003
